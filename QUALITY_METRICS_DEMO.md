# Quality Metrics Implementation - Task 6.3

## Overview

Successfully implemented content quality scoring for Task 6.3 (Optional) of the Tab Content Extraction MVP project. This feature provides simple content quality scoring for UX hints in content previews.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Quality Scoring Algorithm (`src/tabext/contentQuality.ts`)

- **Score Range**: 0-100 points
- **Quality Levels**: Low (0-39), Medium (40-69), High (70-100)

**Scoring Breakdown:**

- Title present: 20 points
- Word count: 0-30 points (scaled, full points at 100+ words)
- Structure indicators: 25 points (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- Code blocks: 15 points
- Tables: 10 points
- Author information: 5 points (bonus)
- Meaningful excerpt: 5 points (bonus)

### 2. Quality Signals

The system detects these quality indicators:

- `hasTitle`: Meaningful title (not "Untitled")
- `hasSufficientWordCount`: 100+ words
- `hasStructure`: Headings, paragraphs, or lists detected
- `hasCode`: Code blocks present
- `hasTables`: Data tables present
- `hasExcerpt`: Meaningful excerpt available
- `hasAuthor`: Author information available

### 3. UI Integration

#### ContentPreview Component (`src/sidebar/components/ContentPreview.tsx`)

- Quality badge in header showing "High Quality", "Medium Quality", or "Low Quality"
- Color-coded badges: Green (high), Yellow (medium), Red (low)
- Tooltip showing numerical score (e.g., "Content quality score: 85/100")
- Detailed quality breakdown in expanded view for scores < 70
- Quality indicators showing what signals are missing/present

#### useContentExtraction Hook (`src/sidebar/hooks/useContentExtraction.ts`)

- Added `qualityAssessment` to return interface
- Automatically calculates quality when content is extracted
- Integrates seamlessly with existing extraction workflow

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { scoreContentQuality } from '@tabext/contentQuality';

const quality = scoreContentQuality(extractedContent);
console.log(`Score: ${quality.score}/100 (${quality.qualityLevel})`);
```

### With React Hook

```typescript
const { content, qualityAssessment, loading, error } = useContentExtraction();

if (qualityAssessment) {
  console.log('Quality signals:', qualityAssessment.signals);
}
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage in `src/tabext/contentQuality.test.ts`:

- ✅ High quality content scoring
- ✅ Medium quality content scoring
- ✅ Low quality content scoring
- ✅ Backwards compatibility with deprecated fields
- ✅ Code block detection
- ✅ Table detection
- ✅ Score boundary validation
- ✅ Utility function tests

All 9 tests passing with proper score validation.

## Integration Points

The quality metrics integrate cleanly with:

1. **Content Extraction Pipeline**: Automatic scoring after extraction
2. **ContentPreview Component**: Visual quality indicators
3. **ContentExtractionExample**: Demo showing quality scores
4. **Existing TypeScript Types**: Full type safety maintained

## Quality Examples

### High Quality (Score: 90+)

- Comprehensive article with clear title
- 150+ words with good structure (headings, paragraphs)
- Code examples and data tables
- Author attribution

### Medium Quality (Score: 45-65)

- Basic title and some content
- Moderate word count (50-100 words)
- Minimal structure
- Missing advanced features

### Low Quality (Score: 15-25)

- Generic or missing title ("Untitled")
- Very short content (<50 words)
- No structural elements
- No code, tables, or author info

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:

- `src/tabext/contentQuality.ts` - Core quality scoring logic
- `src/tabext/contentQuality.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

### Modified:

- `src/sidebar/components/ContentPreview.tsx` - Added quality badges and indicators
- `src/sidebar/hooks/useContentExtraction.ts` - Added quality assessment to hook
- `src/sidebar/components/ContentExtractionExample.tsx` - Added quality score display

## Technical Decisions

1. **Simple Scoring Algorithm**: Lightweight, deterministic scoring based on measurable signals
2. **Optional Enhancement**: Non-critical feature that degrades gracefully
3. **UX-Focused**: Designed as hints for users, not critical functionality
4. **Clean Integration**: Follows existing patterns and doesn't disrupt core extraction

## Build & Deployment

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Vite build successful
- ✅ All quality tests passing
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

The feature is ready for production use and provides valuable UX hints about content quality in the browser sidebar extension.
