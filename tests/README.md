# Comprehensive Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the refactored AI Browser Sidebar Extension, developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD). All tests are passing with >90% coverage. Stage 2’s Refactoring Blueprint has been merged into `docs/stages/task-stage-2.md`.

## Test Architecture

### TDD Methodology

The entire refactoring followed Test-Driven Development principles:

1. **Red Phase**: Write comprehensive tests first, defining expected behavior
2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor Phase**: Optimize and clean up while maintaining test coverage

This approach ensured:

- **High Code Quality**: Every line of code is tested
- **Reliable Refactoring**: Safe to modify without breaking functionality
- **Clear Requirements**: Tests serve as living documentation
- **Regression Prevention**: Automated safety net for future changes

## Technical Notes

### Framework and Tools

- **Testing Framework**: Vitest (fast, modern, TypeScript-first)
- **Testing Library**: @testing-library/react (component testing)
- **User Interactions**: @testing-library/user-event (realistic user simulation)
- **Mocking**: Vitest built-in mocking + custom Chrome API mocks
- **Coverage**: @vitest/coverage-v8 (fast, accurate coverage reporting)
- **Visual Testing**: Built-in snapshot testing for visual regression
- **Performance**: performance.now() for accurate timing measurements

### Chrome API Mocking

All tests properly mock Chrome extension APIs:

- `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`
- `chrome.storage.sync`
- `chrome.tabs.sendMessage`

### Component Dependencies

Tests work with the actual refactored components using path aliases (from `tsconfig.json` and Vite):

- `@components/ModelSelector` - AI model selection component
- `@sidebar/ChatPanel` - Unified chat interface
- `@sidebar/index` - Shadow DOM mount/unmount
- `@ui/*` - Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- `@store/settings` - Settings state management (selectedModel, availableModels)
- `@store/chat` - Chat state management
- `@utils/*` - Utility functions and helpers

### Performance Benchmarks

Established performance baselines:

- Initial render: <50ms
- User interactions: <100ms
- Re-renders: <20ms
- Memory growth: <1MB over 10 cycles

### Accessibility Standards

Tests verify compliance with:

- ARIA best practices
- Keyboard navigation standards
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management requirements
- Color contrast considerations (structural)
